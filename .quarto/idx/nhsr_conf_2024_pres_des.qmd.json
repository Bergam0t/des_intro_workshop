is an early-stage piece of work!\n:::\n\nTo go along with vidigi, I'm working on collating and visualising models from across healthcare systems.\n\nAt present, there is\n\n- A simple emergency department\n- An orthopaedic surgery unit\n- A simple community-based service with a single appointment\n- A complex community-based service with varying numbers of appointments and a per-clinician caseload\n\n[{{< fa brands github>}} &nbsp; Click here for the code repository](https://github.com/hsma-programme/simpy_visualisation/tree/main/examples)\n\n[{{< fa globe>}} &nbsp; Click here to try them out](https://simpy-visualisation.streamlit.app/)\n\n\n## Model Reproducibility\n\n![](resources/stars.png)\n\nReproducibility and reusability of models is crucial.\n\nI want to take a moment to highlight [STARS](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience)\n\nThis is a [UKRI-funded project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR%2FZ503915%2F1) that is trying to ensure good reproducibility of healthcare simulation models.\n\nThey are also creating examples in Python and R, as well as creating open-source versions of closed-source models from published scientific papers.\n\n## The STARS Framework {.smaller}\n\n```{=html}\n<br/>\n```\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n:::  {.column width=\"45%\"}\n#### Essential Components\n\n- Open license\n- Dependency management\n- Model created using free and open-source software (FOSS)\n- Minimum documentation\n- Research artefact meta data (ORCID ID + citation information)\n- Remote code repository\n- Open science archive\n:::\n\n:::  {.column width=\"10%\"}\n\n:::\n\n:::  {.column width=\"45%\"}\n#### Optional Components\n\n- Enhanced documentation\n- Documentation hosting\n- Online coding environment\n- Model interface\n- Web app hosting\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n# End of Simulation\n\n## Summary\n\n- DES is an amazing option for tackling your pathway problems\n<br/><br/>\n- With ever-growing resources and community experience out there, it's a great time to get started\n<br/><br/>\n- FOSS libraries allow us to adapt and reuse models - but follow guidance to make it as easy as possible for people to stand on your shoulders!\n"},"formats":{"revealjs":{"identifier":{"display-name":"RevealJS","target-format":"revealjs","base-format":"revealjs"},"execute":{"fig-width":10,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.9/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"},"slide-level":2,"to":"revealjs","output-file":"index.html","include-in-header":[{"text":"<link
