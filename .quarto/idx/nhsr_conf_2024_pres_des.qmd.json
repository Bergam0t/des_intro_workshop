A delay between patients being referred and receiving their Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumour (TURBT)\n1. A delay waiting for the nurse specialist to contact the patient to discuss their diagnosis and treatment options\n\nThe model was used to support an on-the-spot rewrite of the pathway, resulting in multi-week reductions to waiting times.\n<br/><br/>\n[{{< fa globe >}} Find Out More](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/research/projects/penchord-streamlining-the-bladder-cancer-pathway-at-rcht/)\n\n\n## Example 2: Vaccination Clinic\n\nThis [HSMA](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/) project looked at the design of a COVID-19 vaccination clinic, exploring\n\n- queue lengths\n- car park capacity\n- times for each step of the vaccination process\n\nThe model identified potential issues with the original proposed plans, and was used to refine the plans to enable a safe but efficient delivery of the vaccinations in North Devon.\n<br/><br/>\n[{{< fa globe >}} Find Out More](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/previous_projects/hsma_3/h3_generic_vaccination/)\n\n## Example 3: Emergency Department Model\n\nThis [HSMA](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/) project looked at ways to improve Urgent Treatment Care (UTC) performance.

How changes in the patient pathway would reduce bottlenecks (e.g what would be the impact of front-loading diagnostics?)\n\nThe DES model developed made it easy to understand the impact of changes and what would be most cost-effective.
