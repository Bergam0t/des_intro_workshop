## Pathway Simulation: What and Why?

Healthcare tends to be full of queueing problems.

- People attending a walk-in clinic or emergency department
- People waiting for a series of treatment with a mental health practitioner
-


## Pathway Simulation: What and Why?

- Healthcare systems are full of **resources**
    - People
    - Equipment
    - Rooms, cubicles, beds

## Pathway Simulation: What and Why?

- A system that is coping now might *not* cope
    - all the time
    - if demand increases
    - if resource temporarily decreases

- Changing a healthcare system can be expensive and potentially risky

## Example 1: Bladder Cancer Pathway


## Example 2: Vaccination Clinic


## Example 3: Children's Neurodiversity Assessment Pathway
