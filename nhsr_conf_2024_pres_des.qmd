## Pathway Simulation: What and Why?

Healthcare tends to be full of queueing problems.

- People attending a walk-in clinic or emergency department
- People waiting for a series of treatment with a mental health practitioner
-


## Pathway Simulation: What?

Healthcare systems are full of **resources**

::: {.incremental}
- People 👩🏻‍⚕️ 👩🏿‍⚕️ 👨🏽‍⚕️ 👨🏽‍⚕️ 👩🏾‍⚕️
- Equipment 🔬🩺
- Rooms & cubicles 🏥
- Beds 🛌🏻 🛌🏽 🛌🏿 🛌🏻 🛌🏼 🛌🏽 🛌🏿
- Treatments 💉 🩹 💊
- Vehicles 🚑 🚁 🚗

There is **demand** from **entities** in the form of

## Pathway Simulation: Why?



## Pathway Simulation: Why?

- A system that is coping now might *not* cope
    - all the time
    - if demand increases
    - if resource temporarily decreases

- Changing a healthcare system can be expensive and potentially risky

## Example 2: Vaccination Clinic


## Example 3: Children's Neurodiversity Assessment Pathway

## The DES Playground


## Pathway Visualisation

As part of creating the DES playground, I put together the visualisation you saw in the previous slide.

It really resonated with people at the open day

We know that one of the big limitations of simpy (and other FOSS code-based options) is not being able to produce quick and simple visualisations to show to stakeholders.


## The vidigi package

The visualisation is a

## The STARS Framework

![](resources/stars.png)

Reproducibility and reusability of models is crucial.

[STARS](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience) is a [UKRI-funded project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR%2FZ503915%2F1) that is trying to ensure good reproducibility of healthcare simulation models.
