## HSMA Details

The full HSMA experience is a live, 15-month programme with two distinct phases.

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal" .fragment}

### PHASE 1 - 6 month training phase

Participants learn the Python programming language, before progressing through simulation modelling, mapping, machine learning, natural language processing, website development, reproducible reporting, forecasting, and more.

Participants are released from their usual role for one day a week, joining the HSMA trainers online for **live lectures and group work**.

:::

```{=html}
<br/>
```

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal" .fragment}

### PHASE 2 - 9 month project phase
Participants are supported to produce a project using the new skills they have learned, applying operational research and data science techniques to a real problem within their organisation.

Participants are expected to spend **at least one day a week working on their project** during this phase.

# Pathways

## Pathway Simulation: Why?

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column width="40%"}

![](resources/long_hospital_queue.jpeg){height=400px fig-alt="A stylised image showing very long queues outside of a hospital building"}

:::

:::{.column width="60%"}

Your emergency department is struggling.

You could try a range of different things...

::: {.incremental}
- increase the number of staff available to register, triage or treat
- increase the number of rooms or beds
- increase the rate at which tests can be processed

:::

:::

::::

:::{.incremental}
- add a new step in the process with a different kind of practitioner
- completely redesign the pathway
:::

:::{.fragment .center}
**Which of these is the right answer?**
:::

## Queue, Queue, Barney McGrew

Healthcare tends to be **full** of queueing problems like this one.

::: {.incremental}
- People attending a walk-in clinic or emergency department
- People calling a telephone-based service like 111 or a mental health crisis line
- People on a cancer diagnosis and treatment pathway
- People waiting to be assessed for ADHD and Autism, or on the waiting list for a gender clinic
- People waiting for a series of treatment with a mental health practitioner
    - might have one, several or many appointments
:::

## Pathway Parts

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=50%}

Healthcare systems are full of **resources**

::: {.incremental}
- People 👩🏻‍⚕️ 👩🏿‍⚕️ 👨🏽‍⚕️ 👨🏽‍⚕️ 👩🏾‍⚕️
- Equipment 🔬🩺
- Rooms & cubicles 🏥
- Beds 🛌🏻 🛌🏽 🛌🏿 🛌🏻 🛌🏼 🛌🏽 🛌🏿
- Treatments 💉 🩹 💊
- Vehicles 🚑 🚁 🚗
:::

:::

:::{.column width=50%}

::: {.fragment}

These **resources** experience demand from **entities**.

These entities might be

:::

::: {.incremental}
- People (in person) 🤒 🤢 🤧
- People (on the phone) ☎️
- Test Requests 🩻 🧪
:::

:::

::::

## Pathways and Queues


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=23%}
As these entities move through a pathway - a series of steps where these resources are used - queues can build up where there isn't enough resource.
:::

:::{.column width=7%}
:::

:::{.column width=70%}
![](assets/2024-11-18-10-12-15.png){fig-alt="A pathway showing several steps, starting with 'sign in with receptionist'. One person is signing in; one receptionist is in use and the other is available. A queue of 7 people is then waiting to be triaged. One person is being triaged bby the single available triage nurse. The pathway then splits; one person is seeing a nurse for treatment while two further nurses are available. There is no queue for this step. However, 8 people are waiting to be treated by the single available doctor, who is currently treating someone. People can then either be discharged, receive additional treatment from a nurse or doctor, or may require additional tests. One person is waiting for tests; one person is dealing with the tests while the other is idle. After these tests, people may be discharged, or may need to see a doctor or nurse again."}

## Queue What?

```{=html}
<br/>

And these pathways are often very **complicated**!

There are lots of moving parts, and lots of variation.

## The Problem with Pathways

Making changes to pathways can be

- costly
- slow
- unsafe!

:::{.fragment}
And even if you do fix the original problem you were trying to solve, there's a risk of knock-on effects elsewhere in the pathway that you didn't foresee.
:::

## The *Future* Problems with Pathways

And even if you avoid that....

A system that is coping now might *not* cope

:::{.incremental}
- all the time
- if demand increases
- if resource temporarily decreases
:::


## It's All a Simulation

On HSMA, we teach a couple of different **computer simulation** techniques.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="27%" .fragment}

### System Dynamics

High-level technique that's often suited to uncovering fundamental issues with pathway or wider healthcare system design

:::

::: {.column width="5%" .fragment}

```{=html}
<div style="border-left:3px solid #fff;height:600px"></div>
```

:::


::: {.column width="30%" .fragment}

### Agent-Based Simulation (ABS)

Individual-level modelling that is particularly interested in the impact of individuals' decisions and interactions

:::


::: {.column width='5%' .fragment}

```{=html}

### Discrete Event Simulation (DES)

Modelling focussing on the flow of entities through a pathway and use of resources, allowing detailed investigation of capacity, queues and waits

## It's Our DEStiny

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=25%}
</br></br>
What we generally want to tackle our **pathway** problems in healthcare is **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)**<br/>

![](assets/2024-11-18-09-41-27.png){fig-alt="The top row of this diagram says 'entities' and shows stylised 'emoji' representations of 5 ill people. The next row of the diagram says 'flow through a pathway' and shows a branching diagram of a healthcare pathway with the steps 'arrive', 'sign in with receptionist', 'triaged', 'see nurse', 'see doctor', 'additional tests', 'discharge'. Some steps are optional or may be repeated more than once - the specifics are not important as it is just an indication of what is meant by 'pathway' in this context. The final row says 'using resources along the way' and shows four doctors and three beds as an indication of what resources are in these context."}
:::

::::

## DES to the Rescue

DES is so powerful because it gives us an in-silico (computer-based) reproduction of our pathway to play around with.
<br/><br/>
We can make any change we want<br/>*(e.g. more resources, higher demand, new pathway design)*<br/>**safely and for free** and see what impact it has on any metric we care to measure:

- how long people wait at each step of the pathway
- people meeting targets (e.g. 4 hour wait)
- how much of the time the resources are utilised for
```{=html}
<br/><br/>
```
And so on!

## Variation

We'll explore this more in the interactive part of the workshop, but for now it's just worth mentioning that DES is also really good at dealing with **variation**.

Instead of just planning on **averages** - like the average length of stay, or the average number of people who are referred each month, we can take into account the real-world variation seen, and play out many different possible futures...


## A Note About Modelling

Your DES won't be a perfect one-to-one reproduction of the pathway you are modelling.

We have to make certain assumptions and simplifications, and we can't capture every complexity.

# Example DES Projects

## DES is popular!

- On the HSMA programme, we've had over 35 projects using DES in some capacity
<br/><br/>
- A third of the registered projects this year use DES
(as opposed to machine learning, ABS, system dynamics, natural language processing, geographical modelling)
<br/><br/>
- It's also frequently used in the [PenCHORD](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/research-and-implementation/research-teams/penchord/) team

## Example 1: Bladder Cancer Pathway

In this [PenCHORD](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/research-and-implementation/research-teams/penchord/) project, a DES model of the bladder cancer pathway at Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust (RCHT) exposed two key system bottlenecks.

- A delay between patients being referred and receiving their surgery
- A delay waiting for the nurse specialist to contact the patient to discuss their diagnosis and treatment options

The model was used to support an on-the-spot rewrite of the pathway, resulting in multi-week reductions to waiting times.

## Example 2: Vaccination Clinic

This [HSMA](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/) project looked at the design of a COVID-19 vaccination clinic in North Devon, exploring

- queue lengths
- car park capacity
- times for each step of the vaccination process

The model identified potential issues with the original proposed plans, and was used to refine the plans to enable a safe but efficient delivery of the vaccination programme.
<br/><br/>

## Example 3: Emergency Department Model

This [HSMA](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/) project looked at ways to improve Urgent Treatment Care (UTC) performance. The team wanted to know

- What further staff and resources would be required for any variations in patient attendance
- How changes in the patient pathway would reduce bottlenecks</br> (e.g what would be the impact of front-loading diagnostics?)

The model identified a need for additional rooms and the ED was redesigned as a result.
<br/><br/>

## Example 4: Children's Neurodiversity Assessment Pathway

This [HSMA](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/) project created a model of a paediatric neurodevelopmental (ADHD + autism) pathway. Waits had increased to a 2 years on average.

The team wanted to understand

- where current bottlenecks in the process were
- what level of staffing would be needed to clear the existing backlog and maintain a steady state

The model showed that recruiting an extra lead clinician would not address the bottleneck - but an additional second assessor would.

## Discussion: Opportunities for DES in your Organisations

In your groups, we're going to spend a few minutes discussing opportunities you can see for DES in your organisation.

- Do you have pathways you can see this being applied to?
- Do you know of any simulation models that have already been done or are currently being worked on in your organisation?

We'll then ask you to share some of this with the rest of the group.

# Understanding Simulation Models

For the rest of the session, we're going to play around with an interactive tool to help you build up your understanding of simulation models.

We're going to work with a simple clinic model, gradually adding features.

## Our Goal

First, patients (our <span style="color:cyan;">**entities**)</span> arrive.

:::{.fragment}

They go to a <span style="color:red;">*triage cubicle*</span> and are <span style="color:yellow;">**triaged**</span> into one of two pathways.

:::

```{=html}
<br/>
```

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=45% .fragment}

### 1. Trauma

- Patients are <span style="color:yellow;">**stabilised**</span> in a <span style="color:red;">*trauma bay*</span>
- *All* truma patients are <span style="color:yellow;">**treated**</span> in a <span style="color:red;">*trauma treatment cubicle*</span>

:::

:::{.column width=45% .fragment}

### 2. Non-Trauma

- Patients are <span style="color:yellow;">**registered**</span> in a <span style="color:red;">*registration cubicle*</span>
- Patients are <span style="color:yellow;">**examined**</span> in an <span style="color:red;">*examination room*</span>
- *Some* non-trauma patients are <span style="color:yellow;">**treated**</span> in a <span style="color:red;">*treatment cubicle*</span>

Patients then leave the emergency department.

## Our Goal: Diagram

We can think of our pathway like this.

![](assets/2024-11-25-14-51-19.png)

# DES Step 1: Arrivals

## Where are all the people?

Our simulation first needs some people in it!

We will tell our code to start generating people to place in the simulation - but how are we going to control the rate at which they arrive?

## Variation

That randomness and variation in our healthcare systems that we mentioned before? DES can cope really well with that!

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=40%}

Let's imagine that people turn up to our system, on average, every 10 minutes.

However, sometimes no-one turns up for half an hour, and other times 3 people turn up simultaneously.


:::

:::{.column width=60%}


![](assets/2024-11-25-13-04-09.png)


:::

::::

By using **distributions** we can produce random times that mimic real-world patterns.


## Distributions

We sample the gap between arrivals from a distribution.

Where the bar higher, there is a greater chance that the random number picked will be somewhere around that value.

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=60%}

![](assets/2024-11-19-17-04-14.png)

:::

:::{.column width=40%}
Depending on the real-world pattern we are trying to mimic, our distribution will

- be a different shape
- peak in a different place
:::

::::

## Randomness

Taking it even further, we can harness that variation for making the most of our models.

```{=html}
<br/>
```

:::: {.columns  .fragment}

::: {.column width="45%"}

We can hold the random arrival patterns consistent and **change resource levels or pathway design**

:::

::: {.column width="10%" }

```{=html}
<div style="border-left:3px solid #fff;height:250px"></div>
```

:::

::: {.column width="45%" }

We can hold resources or pathway design consistent and **allow randomness in arrival times**

:::

::::


```{=html}
<br/>
```



:::: {.columns .fragment}

::: {.column width="45%" }

This allows us to be sure the changes we're testing really are responsible for the differences

:::

::: {.column width="10%" }

```{=html}
<div style="border-left:3px solid #fff;height:250px"></div>
```

:::

::: {.column width="45%" }

This allows us to test our system in multiple parallel universes, running it **tens** or even **hundreds** of times!

:::

::::

## Random Seeds

Computers aren’t very good at being random!

So we give it a ‘seed’ to start from.

```{=html}
<br/><br/>
```

If our seed is 1, maybe the arrival times sampled from the distribution will be

**5 minutes, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes**

```{=html}
<br/><br/>
```

If our seed is 101, maybe the arrival times will be

**10 minutes, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 minutes**

## Arrivals Exercise {style="font-size: 70%;"}

1. Try changing the slider with the title 'How many patients should arrive per day on average?'.

    - Look at the graph below it.
        - How does the shape of the distribution change?
        - What does this mean for the time between arrivals?

```{=html}
<br/><br/>
```

2. Change the average number of patients back to the default (80) and click on 'Run simulation'.

    - Look at the charts that show the variation in patient arrivals per simulation run.
    - Look at the chart of cumulative arrivals. By 6am, what was the highest and lowest number of arrivals in different simulation runs?

```{=html}
<br/><br/>
```

3. Try changing the random number the computer uses without changing anything else, then run the simulation again.
    - What happens to the number of patients?
    - Do the bar charts and histograms look different?

# DES Step 2: A Simple Pathway

## Using a Simple Resource

Now we have arrivals, we don’t need much more to make our first full model!

The next thing we need is a resource. 👩🏼‍⚕️

Our entities (🤒🤧🤕🤢) will arrive and hog the resource (👩🏼‍⚕️) for a certain amount of time.

![](assets/2024-11-25-15-02-28.png)

Like the inter-arrival times, we don’t just use a set time for the consultation - we sample from a distribution.


## Metrics Relating to Resources

We can start measuring some more results from our system now:

```{=html}
<br/>
```

**The utilisation of our resource**

(the % of the time that it is in use)

```{=html}
<br/>
```

**The average waits for a resource**

(the number of minutes that pass waiting for someone to reach the front of the queue and be assigned to a resource)

```{=html}
<br/>
```

**The % of patients who meet a target waiting time**

(how many patients wait less than the target time to get to the front of that queue)



## Resource Exercise  {style="font-size: 70%;"}

1. Try changing the sliders for consultation time and variation in consultation time.
    - What happens to the graph below the sliders?

```{=html}
<br/>
```

2. Put the consultation times back to the default (50 minutes length on average, 10 minutes of variation).

    - Run the model and take a look at the animated flow of patients through the system.
    - What do you notice about
        - the number of nurses in use?
        - the size of the queue for treatment at different times?

```{=html}
<br/>
```

3. What happens when you play around with the number of nurses we have available?

    - Look at the queues, but look at the resource utilisation too. The resource utilisation tells us how much of the time each nurse is busy rather than waiting for a patient to turn up.
    - Can you find a middle ground where the nurse is being used a good amount without the queues building up?

# DES Step 3: Branching Pathways

## Adding Complexity

Now, most systems are a bit more complex. Our entities (🤒🤧🤕🤢) might not all follow the same path.

Some might be ill enough to need treatment by a more specialised nurse:

Others can just have some advice and be sent on their way by the first nurse, like before:

## The Revised System

Our revised system looks a bit more like this.

## Dealing with Branches

Like every other step, we use a distribution!

However, this time it’s a bit like flipping a coin.

If we have a 50% probability of a client needing treatment (🏥), it’s like flipping a fair coin.

The other 50% will go home (🏠)

```{=html}
<br/>
```

🏥 🏥 🏠 🏥 🏠 🏠 🏥 🏠 🏠 🏥

```{=html}
<br/>
```

If we make it a 70% probability, it’s like flipping a weighted coin...

🏥 🏥 🏠 🏠 🏠 🏠 🏥 🏠 🏠 🏠

## Variation in Branches

But like flipping a coin, our outcome won’t be exactly the same every time!

## Variation in Variation

While it can vary quite a lot on a single day, over a longer model run, it will average out to be closer to the value we specified - though still not exact.

# Doing your Own DES Projects

Before we go on to our final exercise, let's discuss how you could start modelling your own pathways.

## Drag & Drop

There are various paid, closed-source drag-and-drop software tools for doing DES - but they are often prohibitively expensive.

Using these tools can make it hard to share your models with others.

However, If you don't code, there is the free and open source (FOSS) tool [JaamSim](https://jaamsim.com/).

![](assets/2024-11-18-10-15-22.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the homepage of the website for the JaamSim software. It contains a link to download the software for free, as well as a video showing the use of the software and some key information about the features of the software."}

## DES in Code

The most flexible and powerful way to build your simulations is using code.

<br/><br/>

R has the [simmer](https://r-simmer.org/) package.

:::

:::{.column width=60%}

In Python, there are a range of packages for DES.

HSMA has used and taught [simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for several years. It's mature, stable, reliable and flexible.

## HSMA Training on Web App Interfaces for DES {.smaller}

While creating these models and running a range of parameters yourself can be really powerful, getting the models into the hands of stakeholders can really enhance their adoption.
<br/><br/>
Frameworks like [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) can help you to quickly create interactive web app front-ends for your app.

## Simulation Library

On HSMA, we're trying to collate and visualising models from across healthcare systems.

At present, there is

- A simple emergency department
- An orthopaedic surgery unit
- A simple community-based service with a single appointment
- A complex community-based service with varying numbers of appointments and a per-clinician caseload

More will be added in the coming months.

# DES Step 4: Optimising a Complex Pathway

Now we know how every part of the full model works - so let’s put it all together.

We’ve also added in a tweak here - arrivals now don’t occur at a consistent rate throughout the day.

It’s quieter sometimes and busier at other times, like a real centre!

## The final problem

Due to building work taking place, our hospital will temporarily need to close several bays.

It will be possible to have a maximum of 20 bays/cubicles/rooms in total across the whole system.

**What is the best configuration we can find to keep the average wait times as low as possible?**

:::{.callout-note}
We'll use the default probabilities for trauma/non-trauma patients (0.3) and treatment of non-trauma patients (0.7)

# End of Simulation

## Summary

- DES is an amazing option for tackling your pathway problems
<br/><br/>
- You can create these yourself, or reach out to HSMAs within your organisation or other organisations to create them for you
<br/><br/>
- Code gives maximum flexibility, allowing us to automate problems like our final one so that the computer would find the best solution
